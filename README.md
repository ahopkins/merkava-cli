# Merkava CLI

This is a CLI for accessing a [https://github.com/ahopkins/merkava](MerkavaDB) instance. Since Merkava is still in active development, so is this utility (although I don't see many changes happening in the near future to the CLI).

When Merkava is released, I will push this to PyPI. In the mean time, you can install:

    git clone https://github.com/ahopkins/merkava-cli.git
    cd merkava-cli
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 cli.py

    or

    python3 cli.py <HOST> <PORT>
